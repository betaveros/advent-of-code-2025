# advent of code 2025

i'm washed and doing this pretty casually so i am liberally cleaning up my code, sometimes using noulith features that were added post hoc, occasionally just trying to reconstruct the code from memory

(i did some early days on an iPad with only the [noulith web version](https://betaveros.github.io/noulith/))
